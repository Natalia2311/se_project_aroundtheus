#  Around The U.S.

## Description and Functionality
If the user is not logged in, the page will redirect the user to sign via form. If the user authenticated successfully, she is redirected to the main page. Where she is able to change a profile picture and personal information. The users can add pictures via form by clicking on plus button. The cards from all users are displayed in the gallery. The users are able to like cards by clicking on a heart button.

The page layout is made utilizing CSS and HTML5. Positioning of blocks and elements rely on flexbox and grid. The layout for different screen sizes is adjusted using media querries. 
  
This project is part of the Triple Ten curriculum, designed to teach students advanced HTML, CSS, adaptive web design, and basic JavaScript for DOM manipulation. It also focuses on applying the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to structure the code efficiently. The page is built using semantic elements and follows BEM naming conventions for blocks, elements, and modifiers. Stylesheets are organized within a blocks folder, with all styles imported into the index.css file, which is linked in the <head> section of the HTML document. The webpage is designed to be fully responsive.
A database was integrated through an API, ensuring that user modifications to cards and profile information persist even after the page is reloaded.
