This project is part of the Triple Ten curriculum, designed to teach students advanced HTML, CSS, adaptive web design, and basic JavaScript for DOM manipulation. It also focuses on applying the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to structure the code efficiently. The page is built using semantic elements and follows BEM naming conventions for blocks, elements, and modifiers. Stylesheets are organized within a blocks folder, with all styles imported into the index.css file, which is linked in the <head> section of the HTML document. The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, supporting screen resolutions from 320px to beyond 1280px.
